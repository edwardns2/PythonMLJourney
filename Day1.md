# Day 1

Getting started on my Python Data Analsis / Machine Learning Path. Let's see how we go. 

Using:
1. VSCode
2. Python
3. uv
4. Repo linked to GitHub

Day 1 was all about setting things up in VSCode and getting a virtual environment created and up and runnning.

## Virtual Environment

To create new virtual env, I did the following:

1. VSCode - open Terminal
2. In directory `uv init` and then run `uv run main.py` - this creates the virtual environment
3. Run `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual env
* 4. To deactivate run `deactivate` *
5. Adding Dependencies / Libraries - For example, to add Pandas run `uv add Pandas`
