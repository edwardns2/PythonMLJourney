# Day 1

Getting started on my Python Data Analsis / Machine Learning Path. Let's see how we go. 

Using:
1. VSCode
2. Python
3. uv
4. Repo linked to GitHub

Day 1 was all about setting things up in VSCode and getting a virtual environment created and up and runnning.

## Virtual Environment

To create new virtual env, I did the following:

1. VSCode - open Terminal
2. In directory `uv init` and then run `uv run main.py` - this creates the virtual environment
3. Run `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual env * To deactivate run `deactivate` *
4. Adding Dependencies / Libraries - For example, to add Pandas run `uv add Pandas`

## GitHub Sync

To add file to GitHub repo, I ran:

1. `git status` - see the status of the files
2. `git add .` - add files to the staging area
3. `git commit -m "Initial Commit"` 
4. `git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git`
5. `git branch -M main`
6. `git push -u origin main`

For the next few commits, I just used the Source Control window in VSCode.

Everything seems ot be set up and running as shold be - which is a relief
